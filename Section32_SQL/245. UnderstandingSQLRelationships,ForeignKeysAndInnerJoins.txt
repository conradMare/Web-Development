Exercise done in SQLite Online IDE:

(Docs -> https://www.w3schools.com/sql/)

>>> Create a new Table with FOREIGN KEYS:
CREATE TABLE orders (
  id INT NOT NULL,
  order_number INT,
  customer_id INT,
  product_id INT,
  PRIMARY KEY (id),
  FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers (id),
  FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products (id)
 )

 >>> Insert data into the orders table:
INSERT INTO orders
VALUES (1, 4362, 2, 1)

>>> Create customers table and populate:
CREATE TABLE customers (
  id INT,
  first_name STRING,
  last_name STRING,
  address STRING,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

INSERT INTO customers VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', '32 Cherry Blvd');
INSERT INTO customers VALUES (2, 'Angela', 'Yu', '12 Sunset Drive');
-- fetch some values
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE first_name = 'John';

>>> Using the JOIN keyword to link tables (join orders and customers table):
SELECT orders.order_number, customers.first_name, customers.last_name, customers.address
FROM orders
INNER JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.id;

>>> JOIN orders and products table:
SELECT orders.order_number, products.name, products.price, products.stock
FROM orders
INNER JOIN products ON product_id = products.id;
