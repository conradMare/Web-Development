Kernel -> Core of Operating System.

Shell -> User Interface, which allows you to interact with the Kernel,
         which in return interacts with the hardware of the computer.

         Two Variants: 1. Graphical User Interface (GUI)
                       2. Command Line Interface (CLI)

BASH (Bourne Again SHell) -> CLI Interpreter for the Unix System.

Why use the Command Line?
    1. Greater Control.
    2. Speed.
    3. Shows all files in a directory (including hidden files like config etc.).
